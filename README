isomd5sum provides a way of making use of the ISO9660 application data
area to store md5sum data about the iso.  This allows you to check the
iso given nothing more than the iso itself.

You will need the following packages:

  autoconf
  automake
  libtool
  m4
  popt-devel
  python3-devel

To configure:

  autoreconf -ifv
  ./configure

To build and install checkisomd5 and implantisomd5:

  sudo make install

To build and install pyisomd5sum:

  sudo python3 setup.py install

isomd5sum is hosted on GitHub. The source can be
grabbed via git with
  git clone https://github.com/rhinstaller/isomd5sum.git
or browsed via
  https://github.com/rhinstaller/isomd5sum

Releases of isomd5sum are automatically generated by the tags. eg. for the
1.0.12 release::
  https://github.com/rhinstaller/isomd5sum/archive/1.0.12.tar.gz

You can send questions, enhancements, etc to anaconda-devel-list@redhat.com.
